DataSensingLab
==============

This repository contains code and hardware designs for several different boards associated with the [Data Sensing Lab](http://datasensinglab.com) project.

##Google I/O

![Sensor Motes](Images/SensorMotes.jpg)

Here you can find the code and hardware designs for the sensor motes used by the [Data Sensing Lab](http://datasensinglab.com) at Google I/O in 2013. Details of the previous generation of motes, used at the O'Reilly Strata conferences have their [own repository](https://github.com/aallan/SensorMote). You can now [buy these boards](http://datasensinglab.com/dslstore/) at the Lab Store.

##Data Sensing Lab Workshops
